### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Hey! I'm Owen Ristic a second year Computer Engineer at University of Toronto. I'm really fascinated with understanding 
how the world around us works and how technology affects it. My areas of interest right now are Computer Hardware and Software
and plan to study both of them in the later years of my undergrad. My other interests include singing, sports statistics, and 
video games.
